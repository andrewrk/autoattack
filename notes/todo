Andy:
* start implementing individual IDs
    - make bullets hurt breakable objects and eventually destroy them.
        > when a breakable object is destroyed it should shatter into rubble 
    - make it so if you hit the spike, it goes away, into the ground, and then
      after some specified time it pops back up
    - give the jeep health and gas and a hud display
        > implement power ups
* if you just sit on the up moving platform it gets glitchy at the top
* I think turrets broke, they need to be fixed
* jeep goes in front of the thing it should go behind at the end
* if the jeep blows up, the soldier gets out and you control him
* implement death which restarts the level
* provide an option to toggle sound and music, and
  remember the option with cookies
* bullets travel really fast - need to check points in between for hits
* Optimize/refactor:
    - change inactive LevelObject array to indexed by square x,y
    - separate Level, Transmission, and GamePlay. Move user input to GamePlay
    - split LevelObject into a parent and some subclasses, including 
      explosions, projectiles, etc
* ideas to try fixing physics:
    - just check the points around the wheel to determine if the wheel is 
      in the wall. then move it back along the line of of movement until it is
      no longer in the wall
    - use the point that is furthest in the wall
    - create a testing suite to check the resolvecirclecollision fuction
* level editor:
    - ability to adjust sectors
* level1.xml
    - some sectors need to be adjusted

Josh:
* fix up physics
    - make it smooth
    - maybe make it something other than a rod connecting the wheels
    - make it less springy
