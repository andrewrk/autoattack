Andy:
* start implementing the different class types
* change inactive LevelObject array to indexed by square x,y
* make it so if you hit the spike, it goes away, into the ground, and then
  after some specified time it pops back up
* I foresee a bug: in body.move, it calls level.expireBody which calls engine.removeBody which deletes the item from the array, then it goes to the next index, skipping a body in the physics update
* create a level editor
* fix up level1
    - move booster thing down and to the right a little
* add movie clips for the bad guys
* start adding code to make level objects work

Josh:
* make jeep physics work
* add wheels to jeep
