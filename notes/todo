Andy:
* create a framework for the enemy class type
    - add movie clips for the bad guys
    - add behavior for the bad guys
* change inactive LevelObject array to indexed by square x,y
* move body.paint to level
* I foresee a bug: stuff references jeep, thinking it is the player, when really they should reference level.getPlayerPos() because the dude can get out of the jeep.
* create a level editor
* fix up level1
    - move booster thing down and to the right a little
* start implementing individual IDs
    - give the jeep health and gas and a hud display
    - implement weaponry
    - add explosions
    - implement death which restarts the level
    - make it so if you hit the spike, it goes away, into the ground, and then
      after some specified time it pops back up
* if the jeep blows up, the soldier gets out and you control him
* make turrets not overshoot their angle when rotating
* entities are still on the screen when masks aren't. this is a problem.

Josh:
* make jeep physics work
* add wheels to jeep
