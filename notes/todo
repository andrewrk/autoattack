* Convert to AS3
    - one main object loaded by flash. controls preloading, title screen,
      game play, etc
    - const keyword
    - private / protected / public
    - int, uint
    - movieclips / sprites / etc
    - loaders
    - display list and visible display list
    - event handling
    - restructure code layout?
    - use vectors instead of array
* preloader doesn't show progress
* implement a crosshair
* remove my extraneous needsGravity code from flade
* bullets travel really fast - need to check points in between for hits
* MovingPlatform:
    - if you just sit on the up moving platform it gets glitchy at the top
    - make the arrow on MovingPlatform point in the direction of vel
    - make it so on that up platform you can't fall through on the right side
* trap door and switch
* give the jeep health and gas and a hud display
    - provide an option to toggle sound and music, and
      remember the option with cookies
* make it so the jeep can get hit by bullets, and they apply force on the jeep
* gas can gives you more gas make the progress bar smooth
* health pack gives you more health
* glass pane graphic sucks
* boosters:
    - some kind of visual and audio when you get a booster
    - place the boosters in better locations on the map
    - allow you to specify boost direction and strength in level.xml. use better
      boost drawing and point it so it's obvious which direction it sends you
* Spike:make it so if you hit the spike, it goes away, into the ground, and then
  after some specified time it pops back up
* Soldiers:
    - parachutes and ninja ropes for soldiers
    - give soldiers the ability to run
    - make soldiers seem smarter
    - make blood come out of the soldiers when you hit them once
    - make it so you can run soldiers over
    - implement different weapons and projectiles for soldiers
    - use a better graphic for enemy soldiers
* make it so either you can or can't destroy turrets. if you can, provide some
  indication when it is hit. same as if you cannot.
* when a breakable object is destroyed it should shatter into rubble and smoke
* trigger: instant death. jeep explodes and you lose
* trigger: helicopter attack
* trigger: level complete
* trigger: jeep explodes but driver hops out unharmed
* implement helicopters
* implement explosions - they should apply force to physics objects nearby
* implement the cannon
* implement the vent that drops goodies
* implement explosive barrels
* implement mines
* implement rubble
* if the jeep blows up, the soldier gets out and you control him
* implement death which gets you scolded by the general (pretend you died
  and you are now controlling another soldier)
* Optimize/refactor:
    - change inactive LevelObject array to indexed by square x,y
    - separate Level, Transmission, and GamePlay. Move user input to GamePlay
    - adjust swf quality for speed
* level1.swf
    - some sectors need to be adjusted
* make explosive barrels rectangles instead of particles and make them bump 
  into each other
* make the jeep take damage when it crashes into something
* recognize when flipped on the ground, and make the guy come out and un-flip it
    - hit test the jeep shell
    - if you get flipped, the wheels should be suspended useless in the air.
      the dude can come out and flip it over.
* if you do a flip in mid-air do some fun thing to recognize it
* something weird is happening at the end
* sound effects for EVERYTHING
