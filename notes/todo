* start implementing individual IDs
    - make bullets hurt breakable objects and eventually destroy them.
        > when a breakable object is destroyed it should shatter into rubble 
    - make it so if you hit the spike, it goes away, into the ground, and then
      after some specified time it pops back up
    - give the jeep health and gas and a hud display
        > implement power ups
* if you just sit on the up moving platform it gets glitchy at the top
* I think turrets broke, they need to be fixed
* if the jeep blows up, the soldier gets out and you control him
* implement death which restarts the level
* provide an option to toggle sound and music, and
  remember the option with cookies
* bullets travel really fast - need to check points in between for hits
* Optimize/refactor:
    - change inactive LevelObject array to indexed by square x,y
    - separate Level, Transmission, and GamePlay. Move user input to GamePlay
    - split LevelObject into a parent and some subclasses, including 
      explosions, projectiles, etc
* level editor:
    - ability to adjust sectors
* level1.swf
    - some sectors need to be adjusted
* when an activation gate is created you see it on screen in the wrong spot
  for one frame.
* implement a crosshair
* some kind of visual and audio when you get a booster
* place the boosters in better locations on the map
* display bar with health, gas, etc
* make explosive barrels rectangles instead of particles and make them bump 
  into each other
* implement explosions
