Andy:
* start implementing individual IDs
    - make bullets hurt breakable objects and eventually destroy them.
        > when a breakable object is destroyed it should shatter into rubble 
    - make it so if you hit the spike, it goes away, into the ground, and then
      after some specified time it pops back up
    - give the jeep health and gas and a hud display
        > implement power ups
* level editor:
    - ability to adjust sectors
    - ability to change classes and ids
    - ability to adjust width, height, and dir
* level1.xml
    - some decorations are floating
    - some things need to be resized
    - some sectors need to be adjusted
* if the jeep blows up, the soldier gets out and you control him
* implement death which restarts the level
* fix background music and provide an option to toggle sound and music, and
  remember the option with cookies
* bullets travel really fast - need to check points in between for hits
* Optimize/refactor:
    - change inactive LevelObject array to indexed by square x,y
    - separate Level, Transmission, and GamePlay. Move user input to GamePlay
    - split LevelObject into a parent and some subclasses, including 
      explosions, projectiles, etc

Josh:
* fix up physics
    - make it smooth
    - maybe make it something other than a rod connecting the wheels
    - make it less springy
